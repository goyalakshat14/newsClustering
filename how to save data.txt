you can make a mongodb server and save data there.
so node can interact with mongodb and python can interact with mongodb but node and python dont have to interact with one another atall.

Then to store your cluster you can either make a dict or list of clusters and store all the feed in that,
or 
you can save the feed with cluster no as parameter in it

Should you store the features all the feed in the database
or should you generate feature all over again

Should you store the mean of all the data indivisually
